/* 
 * This file contains global CSS styles for the app.
 * 
 * It is responsible for:
 * - Importing Tailwind base, components, and utilities
 * - Setting up color variables for the brand in :root
 * - Overriding small details to achieve a production-ready look
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Enhanced brand color usage
 * - Maintains dark mode logic
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Tailwind classes
 *
 * Notes:
 * - We only lightly touched default color variables
 * - If you want to dramatically change brand colors, do so in tailwind.config.ts

/* Basic Tailwind layers */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* 
  We keep most of the default variables the same,
  but you could tweak them here for final brand coloration.
*/

@layer base {
  :root {
    /* Slight tweak: sidebar border to look more consistent with brand */
    --sidebar-border: 220 10% 80%;
  }

  /* Dark mode overrides remain the same */
  .dark {
    --sidebar-border: 240 3.7% 30.9%;
  }
}

/* 
  No major changes to main body logic, 
  as production readiness typically 
  means consistent color usage & spacing (which we've done).

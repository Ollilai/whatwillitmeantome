/**
 * @description
 * This server page file creates a new route for the "WhatWillItMeantome" flow.
 *
 * It is responsible for:
 * - Providing a dedicated page in the `(marketing)/whatwillitmeantome/` folder
 * - Laying the foundation for the user input form and AI report display in future steps
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Utilizes the existing marketing layout automatically (because it's placed under `(marketing)/`)
 * - Configured as a Next.js 13 server component (`"use server"`)
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - Next.js 13 App Router for route structuring
 * - Layout from `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` for consistent marketing layout
 *
 * @notes
 * - Currently serves as a placeholder. Step 6 will implement the form logic.

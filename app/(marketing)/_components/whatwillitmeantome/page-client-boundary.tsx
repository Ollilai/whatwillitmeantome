/**
 * @description
 * This client component handles the state for the "WhatWillItMeantome" page.
 * It stores the AI data after a successful analysis and conditionally renders
 * the report display and placard.
 *
 * @responsibilities
 * - Maintain the mistralData state
 * - Render <FormWrapper> which calls Mistral AI
 * - Render the final <ReportDisplay> and <Placard> once data is available
 *
 * @notes
 * - The disclaimers are in the server component above, but we also show disclaimers
 *   within the <ReportDisplay> itself.
